          to keep this site classified as a non-adult-content site in order to
          provide you with lower fees. We welcome SW's but this decision is

        <h2>What gifts are prohibited from putting on my wishlist?</h2>
        <Typography>
          You can put any item or custom gift on your wishlist. But you cannot
          list your services, nor gifts that promise any service or goods in
          exchange for the gift. If you want a gift for a service you provided,
          you can list a tip or gift and ask your client privately to buy that
          gift or tip for that service.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          We don't allow listing services because, as a wishlist site, we cannot
          be responsible for ensuring the guarantee of any services, goods, nor
          exchanges. No overt nudity is allowed in the images for the items.
          This allows us to keep our fees low for you and your fans. As
          mentioned above, we welcome SW's but this decision is ultimately to
          help you get gifts from fans without getting the high fees you may

        <h2>Why are the countries different for wishers and gifters?</h2>
        <Typography>
          {" "}
          Our payment processor can accept funds from many currencies, but can
          only pay out funds to a limited amount of countries.
        </Typography>
        <h2>Will you add more countries?</h2>
        <Typography>
          Yes. Our payment processor is accommodating more countries and
          currencies over time. Let us know what countries you are interested in
          and weâ€™ll see if it can be accommodated.
        </Typography>
        <h2>How much of the money for the gift do I get?</h2>
        <Typography>
          You get the total amount you listed. If there's a currency conversion
          then you may get MORE or LESS than you listed because of discrepancies
          between exchange rates. It shouldn't be too much of a difference, but
          if it is let us know.
        </Typography>
        <h2>How do you make money if itâ€™s 100% payout?</h2>
        <Typography>
          We charge the gifter a 10% fee on top of the gift price. Wishers
          receive the price they listed, unless there's a currency conversion.
        </Typography>
        <h2>How long does it take to get my gift funds?</h2>
        <Typography>
          The <strong>first gift</strong> you receive on WishTender takes 7-14
          days to payout because of our payment processor's security protocol.
          However, users have pleasantly reported that the first payout can be
          as fast as 2 days.{" "}
        </Typography>{" "}
        <Typography>
          For every gift after the first gift, you will receive the funds on the
          next payout day. Payout days occur every{" "}
          <strong>two business days</strong>.
        </Typography>
        <h2>How can I trust WishTender?</h2>
        <Typography>
          We are a very new company, but we're happy to connect you with users
          who have received gifts using WishTender. Unlike many sites in the
          industry that are built by anonymous founders, WishTender is openly
          being built by{" "}

          , a former nude model turned software developer. We are putting our
          reputation on line to keep ourselves accountable to delivering a solid
          product.
        </Typography>
        <h2>How is WishTender sex worker friendly if it uses Stripe?</h2>
        <Typography>
          Stripe allows our users to get gifts from clients no matter what
          industry they are in since you are getting gifts and not selling
          content on the site.
        </Typography>
        <h2>What fees do you charge?</h2>
        <Typography>
          We charge 10% to the gift purchaser. There are no fees for the
          wishlist owner.
        </Typography>
        <h2>Do you allow refunds?</h2>
        <Typography>
          In order to keep you safe from return scams, WishTender does not allow
          refunds, except in specific cases, such as if the fan purchased the
          wrong item and in which the wisher agrees to the refund.
        </Typography>
        <h2>What of my information is visible?</h2>
        <Typography>
          If you're a wisher, gifters can only see what's on your wishlist. They
          cannot see your real name or any payment information.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          If you're a gifter, wishers can only see your gift message and the
          name you leave on the gift message. They cannot see your payment
          information, real name, or email.
        </Typography>
        <h2>How do gifts that I purchased show up on my credit card bill?</h2>
        <Typography>
          They will show up as WishTender LLC. You will <strong>not</strong> see
          the specific wisher's wishlist on your credit card bill.
        </Typography>
        <h2>How is WishTender different than Amazon wishlists?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>We are more flexible than Amazon.</strong> Since wishers get
            the funds to purchase the gift, you can list anything on your
            wishlist not just Amazon products; But also items from any site or
            even offline items like spa days, full outfits, or having your rent
            funded.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We are safer than Amazon.</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                We donâ€™t allow gifters to initiate returns. This helps you avoid
                a fan claiming they got you a gift, only to have them cancel it
                later.
              </li>
              <li>
                Purchasers can call up Amazon stores and request your address.
                On WishTender, your information is totally private.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>We're made for creators.</strong> We have features that
            Amazon doesn't have with you in mind. For example, you can leave a
            thank you picture note within WishTender. And we're constantly
            looking to improve the site to fit your needs.
