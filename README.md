This is the frontend for WishTender. WishTender is a wishlist app catered to content creators to allow them to get gifts safely from fans.

## `npm start` vs `npm run startlocal`
If you run `npm start` it will connect to the remote backend. If you have the a local backend running on port 4000 you can run `npm run startlocal` instead.

This react app pretty much wont load it you don't have the backend up.
